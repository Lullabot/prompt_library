# Nano Banana Prompt Generator

## Overview

Nano Banana is Google's autoregressive image generation model (also known as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, and the Pro version as Gemini 3 Pro Image). This skill generates optimized prompts that leverage Nano Banana's unique capabilities: strong prompt adherence, character consistency, and nuanced control through structured formatting.

## Core Prompting Formula

Every Nano Banana prompt follows this structure:

**Subject + Action + Environment + Art Style + Lighting + Details**

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Subject | Main character or object | "A three-meter tall corrupted construct" |
| Action | What the subject is doing | "stalking through ruins" |
| Environment | Location/background | "ancient forge facility" |
| Art Style | Visual aesthetic | "dark fantasy concept art" |
| Lighting | Light sources and quality | "bioluminescent inner glow" |
| Details | Specific requirements | "crystalline growths, pulsing core" |

## Key Techniques

### 1. Use Markdown Formatting

Structure prompts with headers, bullet points, and sections. Nano Banana's text encoder parses markdown effectively.

```markdown
# Subject
[Main focus description]

## Core Design
- Detail 1
- Detail 2

## Environment
[Background/setting]
```

### 2. Capitalize Enforcement Keywords

Use ALL CAPS for critical requirements:
- **MUST** - Mandatory elements
- **DO NOT** - Forbidden elements
- **ONLY** - Exclusive requirements

Example: "The composition MUST use portrait orientation"

### 3. Specify Technical Parameters

Include camera and composition specifications:

| Parameter | Options |
|-----------|---------|
| Aspect Ratio | 16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2 |
| Camera | Canon EOS 90D, 24mm wide angle, 85mm portrait |
| Composition | Rule of thirds, golden ratio, centered |
| Perspective | Eye level, low angle, bird's eye, Dutch angle |
| Depth of Field | Shallow, deep, selective focus |

### 4. Layer Lighting Sources

Specify multiple light sources for depth:

```markdown
## Lighting
- Primary: [Main light source and direction]
- Secondary: [Fill light or ambient]
- Accent: [Rim light, highlights, glows]
```

### 5. Use Prestige Anchoring

Reference acclaimed artists or prestigious descriptors to improve quality:

| Category | Effective Anchors |
|----------|-------------------|
| Dark Fantasy | "Beksinski meets industrial horror" |
| Illustration | "Bernie Wrightson, Gustave Doré" |
| Photo Quality | "Pulitzer Prize winning photograph" |
| Concept Art | "Art station trending, Weta Workshop" |
| Portrait | "Annie Leibovitz lighting" |

### 6. Include Negative Constraints

Always add a "Do NOT Include" section:

```markdown
## Do NOT Include
- Text, watermarks, or logos
- Modern anachronistic elements
- [Style-specific exclusions]
```

## Prompt Template

Use this template structure for all Nano Banana prompts:

```markdown
# [Title/Subject Name]

## Format Specifications
- **Orientation**: [Portrait/Landscape/Square] ([aspect ratio])
- **Color**: [Full color / Black and white / Limited palette]
- **Purpose**: [Book illustration / Concept art / Character design]

## Subject
[Detailed description of the main focus]

## Core Design
- [Key visual element 1]
- [Key visual element 2]
- [Key visual element 3]

## Critical Details (MUST include)
- [Non-negotiable element 1]
- [Non-negotiable element 2]

## Environment
[Setting, background, atmospheric details]

## Art Style
[Specific aesthetic, artist references, medium]

## Lighting
- Primary: [Main light]
- Secondary: [Fill/ambient]
- Accent: [Highlights/glows]

## Composition
[Rule of thirds, framing, focal points, camera specs]

## Atmosphere/Mood
[Emotional tone, narrative context]

## Technical Specifications
[Print quality, detail density, rendering style]

## Do NOT Include
- [Exclusion 1]
- [Exclusion 2]
- [Exclusion 3]
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Parameters

Collect from user or determine from context:

| Parameter | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Subject | What is the main focus of the image? |
| Purpose | Book illustration, concept art, character sheet, scene? |
| Style | Realistic, stylized, illustrated, photographic? |
| Format | Portrait, landscape, square? Color or B&W? |
| Mood | What emotion or atmosphere? |
| References | Any existing art style or artist to match? |

### Step 2: Analyze Source Material

When generating prompts from written descriptions (scenes, chapters, etc.):

1. Identify the most visually dynamic moment
2. Extract specific physical details (colors, materials, scale)
3. Note environmental context
4. Capture emotional/atmospheric tone
5. Identify any unique or fantastical elements requiring special attention

### Step 3: Structure the Prompt

Build the prompt using the template, ensuring:

1. **Subject section** clearly establishes the main focus
2. **Core Design** breaks down visual components systematically
3. **MUST/DO NOT** sections enforce critical requirements
4. **Art Style** anchors to recognizable aesthetics
5. **Lighting** creates depth with multiple sources
6. **Composition** specifies camera and framing

### Step 4: Validate and Refine

Check the prompt against these criteria:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Specificity | Are measurements, colors, materials explicit? |
| Enforcement | Are critical elements marked with MUST/ONLY? |
| Exclusions | Is there a DO NOT section? |
| Style Anchor | Is there a prestige reference? |
| Technical Specs | Are format, camera, lighting specified? |
| Clarity | Could another AI parse this unambiguously? |

## Special Formats

### Black and White Illustration

Add these specifications:
```markdown
## Format Specifications
- **Color**: BLACK AND WHITE ONLY—high contrast monochromatic, no color

## Art Style
- High contrast black and white ink illustration
- Style: [Artist reference] (e.g., Bernie Wrightson, Frank Miller)
- Heavy blacks for shadows
- Pure whites for highlights
- Crosshatching for texture and gradation
```

### Character Design Sheet

Add these specifications:
```markdown
## Format Specifications
- **Purpose**: Character design reference sheet
- **Views**: Front, 3/4, profile (or specify which)

## Character Details
- Height/build reference
- Distinctive features
- Costume/clothing breakdown
- Color callouts (if color)
- Expression range (if multiple expressions)
```

### Action Scenes

Add motion indicators:
```markdown
## Motion and Energy
- Speed lines style: [Classic illustration / manga / subtle blur]
- Motion direction: [Left-to-right / diagonal / toward camera]
- Dynamic elements: [Hair, clothing, debris, particles]
- Frozen moment: [Describe the exact instant captured]
```

## Quality Standards

Every generated prompt must:

1. **Use Markdown Structure** - Headers, bullets, clear sections
2. **Include Format Specs** - Orientation, color mode, purpose
3. **Specify Subject Clearly** - Main focus with physical details
4. **Enforce Critical Elements** - MUST/DO NOT sections present
5. **Anchor Style** - Artist reference or prestige descriptor
6. **Layer Lighting** - At least 2 light sources described
7. **Define Composition** - Camera, framing, focal point
8. **Exclude Unwanted Elements** - Clear DO NOT section

## Example Usage

User: "Create a prompt for a dragon attacking a castle at sunset"

Response approach:
1. Determine format (likely landscape for epic scene)
2. Establish subject (dragon as focus, castle as environment)
3. Select style anchors (fantasy art references)
4. Specify dramatic sunset lighting (golden hour + fire)
5. Add motion for attack (wings, fire breath, debris)
6. Exclude common unwanted elements (text, watermarks)
7. Structure using full template

## Editing Images (Nano Banana Pro)

When editing existing images rather than generating new ones, use these five action words:

| Action | Use Case | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Add** | Insert new elements | "Add a dragon flying in the background" |
| **Change** | Modify existing elements | "Change the sky to sunset colors" |
| **Make** | Transform qualities | "Make the character look older" |
| **Remove** | Delete elements | "Remove the text in the corner" |
| **Replace** | Substitute elements | "Replace the sword with an axe" |
`````
