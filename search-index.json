Provide context if necessary (briefly)\n\nAfter extracting the action items, provide a brief summary of how many action items you found.\n\nFormat your response as follows:\n1. List each action item in a numbered list\n2. Use bold text for the main task\n3. Use italics for the responsible person or team\n4. Include deadlines in parentheses\n5. Add a brief context or note if needed, separated by a colon\n\nYour final output should only include the numbered list of action items followed by the summary of the number of items found.

Your task is to clean up this transcript to make it more readable while maintaining the original content and meaning.\n\n## Instructions\n\nFollow these steps to clean up the transcript:\n\n1. Remove all timestamps from the transcript.\n\n2. Combine consecutive entries from the same author into a single paragraph. For example:\n\n   \n   John [10:15]: Hello there.\n   John [10:16]: How are you?\n   \n\n   Should become:\n   \n   John: Hello there. How are you?\n   \n\n3. Remove filler words and slight interjections such as \"Um\", \"Ah\", \"Uh\", \"Er\", and similar sounds. Only remove these when they are used as filler words and not when they are part of the actual content.\n\n4. Maintain the overall content and meaning of the text. Do not paraphrase or summarize the content. Keep the exact wording except for the removals mentioned above.\n\n5. Format the cleaned transcript as follows:\n   - Start each new speaker's dialogue with their name followed by a colon.\n   - Use a blank line to separate different speakers' dialogues.\n   - If a single speaker's dialogue is very long, you may split it into paragraphs for readability, but do not add blank lines between these paragraphs.\n\n6. Ensure that the cleaned transcript remains true to the original content, preserving the flow of the conversation and all important information.\n\nOnce you have cleaned up the transcript according to these instructions, please provide the cleaned version in a new markdown file. Process the entire transcript and verify once complete. \n`````","data":{"title":"Readable Zoom Transcripts","description":"A prompt for cleaning and formatting meeting transcripts to improve readability while maintaining content integrity.","date":"2024-04-04","layout":"markdown.njk","discipline":"project-management","contentType":"prompts","tags":["transcription","meetings","documentation","communication"]},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"url":"/prompt_library/project-management/prompts/readable-zoom-transcripts/","discipline":"project-management","contentType":"prompts","tags":["transcription","meetings","documentation","communication"],"date":"2024-04-04"},{"title":"Summarize This","description":"A prompt for summarizing long transcripts of meetings, YouTube videos, and other content","content":{"content":"\r\n# A prompt for summarizing long transcipts of meetings, YouTube videos, etc.\r\n\r\n`````\r\nWhen creating a summary, include:\r\n\r\n- A brief introduction explaining the video's main purpose/problem\r\n- A detailed breakdown of all major points, with specific examples from the video\r\n- Sub-sections for each key concept with explanations of how they connect\r\n- Practical applications of the ideas presented\r\n- Any frameworks or systems the presenter introduces\r\n- Notable quotes or specific terminology used by the presenter\r\n\r\nStructure the summary with clear headings and bullet points where appropriate to enhance readability.\r\n\r\n## Summary rules for sizing\r\n\r\nIF request contains \"short\" OR \"small\" THEN use 250-300 words to summarize\r\nIF request contains \"medium\" THEN use 300-500 words  to summarize\r\nIF request contains \"long\" OR \"large\" THEN use 500-750 words to summarize \r\nIF no size preference is detected THEN ask for clarification\r\n`````","data":{"title":"Summarize This","description":"A prompt for summarizing long transcripts of meetings, YouTube videos, and other content","date":"2025-04-11","layout":"markdown.njk","discipline":"project-management","contentType":"prompts","tags":["summary","transcripts","meetings","video"]},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"url":"/prompt_library/project-management/prompts/summarize-this/","discipline":"project-management","contentType":"prompts","tags":["summary","transcripts","meetings","video"],"date":"2025-04-11"},{"title":"","description":"","content":{"content":"# Prompt Library\n\nA collection of AI prompts, cursor rules, project configurations, and workflow states across different disciplines.

It eliminates the need to search across disparate locations or rely on ad-hoc sharing methods.\n\n## How It Should Work\nThe collection is presented through a web user interface built with the 11ty static site generator. Content is stored in flat Markdown files and organized by discipline (e.g., Project Management, Development). Users access the content via this web UI.\n\n## User Experience Goals\nThe user experience should be straightforward and intuitive. Users should be able to:\n*   Easily search for specific content using a search bar.\n*   Browse content categorized by discipline.\n*   Find clear instructions on how to contribute their own content to the library.\n*   **Contribution Strategy:** Employ an \"invite and curate\" model, encouraging contributions through various channels, including user-friendly GitHub Issue Templates/Forms, with maintainers handling the final integration.

Checkout code.\n    2. Setup Node.js & cache npm dependencies.\n    3. Install dependencies (`npm install`).\n    4. Build site (`npm run build`) - output to `./_site`.\n    5. Deploy `./_site` contents to `gh-pages` branch using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4`.\n- The build process adapts URLs based on `process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS` (adds `/prompt_library` base path), configured in `.eleventy.js`.\n- A `baseUrl` global variable and `pathPrefix` are configured in `.eleventy.js` to handle deployment to GitHub Pages subpath.\n\n## Contribution Process\n- Contribution guidelines are documented in the `contributing.njk` page.\n- **Methods:**\n    - **GitHub Direct:** Standard Fork -> Branch -> Add File -> Commit -> PR workflow.\n    - **Cursor:** Recommends using Cursor AI with the `prompt-library-requirements` rule for guided content creation.\n    - **GitHub Issues:** Allows users to suggest content via issues tagged \"Content Suggestion:\".\n- **Content Requirements:**\n    - **Metadata (Frontmatter):** `title`, `description`, `date`, `tags` (min 2).\n    - **Formatting:** Markdown, clear headings, code blocks, reasonable line length, lists.\n    - **Validation:** Check metadata, preview locally (`npm start`), validate links/code, check style.\n- The `contributing.njk` page includes an accordion UI (JS/CSS) to present the methods.\n\n### Planned Contribution Workflow (via Issue Templates)\n- **Initiation:** Contributor selects an Issue Template (e.g., for prompts) and fills out the form.\n- **Submission:** A GitHub Issue is created with structured data and specific labels (e.g., `new-contribution`, `needs-review`).\n- **Curation:** Maintainer reviews the issue, verifies the content, and potentially refines the data (e.g., adds tags).\n- **Conversion:** Maintainer manually creates the corresponding Markdown file in the correct location, populating the frontmatter and content from the issue data.\n- **Integration:** Maintainer commits the new file, typically via a PR, for final review and merge.
