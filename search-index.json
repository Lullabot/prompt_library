Use second-person (\"you\") to address the reader\n2. Represent the company with \"we\" (first-person plural)\n3. Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences maximum)\n4. Vary sentence length for rhythm and readability\n5. Use active voice predominantly\n6. Break text with meaningful headings and subheadings\n7. Define technical terms for broader audience understanding\n8. Follow American English spelling conventions\n9. Avoid idioms and unnecessary metaphors for global accessibility\n\n## Avoid Idioms and Unnecessary Metaphors\n\nWhile colorful language can add personality to writing, idioms and metaphors often create barriers for our global audience and can make content sound artificial or overly casual. As a general rule, choose clear, direct language over idiomatic expressions.\n\n### Why Avoid Idioms?\n\n- **Accessibility for Non-Native Speakers**: Our audience includes developers, strategists, and business stakeholders worldwide. Idioms don't translate well and can confuse readers whose first language isn't English.\n- **Professional Clarity**: Technical content requires precision. Idioms can muddy meaning and distract from your core message.\n- **Avoiding \"AI-Generated\" Sound**: Overuse of idioms and clichéd metaphors can make content sound generic or artificially generated.\n- **Better SEO Performance**: Search engines and readers alike prefer clear, descriptive language over figurative expressions.\n- **Inclusive Communication**: Direct language ensures all readers, regardless of cultural background or reading level, can understand your content.\n\n### Examples: Do and Don't\n\n#### ❌ DON'T Use These Idioms\n\n- Instead of: \"This API integration was a piece of cake.\" Write: \"This API integration was straightforward to implement.\"\n- Instead of: \"This legacy code is a can of worms.\" Write: \"This legacy code presents multiple interconnected challenges.\"\n\n#### ✅ DO Use Clear, Direct Language\n\n- Good: \"The database optimization reduced page load times by 40%.\" Better than: \"The database optimization was a game-changer for page speed.\"\n- Good: \"We identified three critical security vulnerabilities.\" Better than: \"We found some real red flags in the security audit.\"\n\n### When Metaphors Work\n\nMetaphors can be effective when they:\n\n- Clarify complex technical concepts\n- Are widely understood across cultures\n- Add genuine value to comprehension\n\n**Effective metaphor**: \"Database indexes work like a book's table of contents—they help you find information quickly without scanning every page.\"\n\n**Ineffective metaphor**: \"Our development workflow is smoother than butter on a hot skillet.\"\n\n### Quick Self-Check\n\nBefore publishing, scan your content for:\n\n- Phrases that don't translate literally\n- Expressions your international colleagues might not understand\n- Overused business clichés\n- Metaphors that don't enhance understanding\n\n**Remember**: When in doubt, choose clarity over cleverness.\n\n## Examples\n\n<example>\n**Technical Introduction**\n\n\"Managing content across multiple platforms presents unique challenges for enterprise organizations.

Your task is to clean up this transcript to make it more readable while maintaining the original content and meaning.\n\n## Instructions\n\nFollow these steps to clean up the transcript:\n\n1. Remove all timestamps from the transcript.\n\n2. Combine consecutive entries from the same author into a single paragraph. For example:\n\n   \n   John [10:15]: Hello there.\n   John [10:16]: How are you?\n   \n\n   Should become:\n   \n   John: Hello there. How are you?\n   \n\n3. Remove filler words and slight interjections such as \"Um\", \"Ah\", \"Uh\", \"Er\", and similar sounds. Only remove these when they are used as filler words and not when they are part of the actual content.\n\n4. Maintain the overall content and meaning of the text. Do not paraphrase or summarize the content. Keep the exact wording except for the removals mentioned above.\n\n5. Format the cleaned transcript as follows:\n   - Start each new speaker's dialogue with their name followed by a colon.\n   - Use a blank line to separate different speakers' dialogues.\n   - If a single speaker's dialogue is very long, you may split it into paragraphs for readability, but do not add blank lines between these paragraphs.\n\n6. Ensure that the cleaned transcript remains true to the original content, preserving the flow of the conversation and all important information.\n\nOnce you have cleaned up the transcript according to these instructions, please provide the cleaned version in a new markdown file.

Write code that is easy to read and understand\n2. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle\n3. Keep functions and methods small and focused\n4. Use meaningful variable and function names\n5. Document complex logic and decisions\n6. In PHP, use data objects instead of arrays. Arrays should be converted to objects as soon as possible. If the project is using PHP 8.4 or higher, and set or get style methods are needed, use [property hooks](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks). This does not apply to Drupal's render or form APIs.\n\n## Error handling\n1. Use exceptions for error conditions instead of NULL or FALSE returns.\n2. Do not catch \\Exception. Only catch exceptions that can be handled by a new code path.\n3. When catching exceptions, always catch the narrowest exception possible. For example, if a function throws \\RuntimeException, catch that instead of \\Exception.\n4. Do not catch exceptions simply to log them, unless the code is specifically trying to declare that the error state does not affect the caller of the method.\n5. New exceptions should inherit from existing exception classes where possible.\n\n## Code Style\n- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)\n- Follow language-specific style guides\n- Use proper spacing around operators\n- Limit line length to 80-100 characters\n- Use descriptive comments where necessary\n- Always leave an empty new line at the end of a file\n\n## Testing\n- Write tests for all new functionality\n- Maintain test coverage above 80%\n- Include both unit and integration tests\n- Test edge cases and error conditions\n- Keep tests independent and isolated\n\n## Documentation\n- Document public APIs and interfaces\n- Include usage examples\n- Keep README files up to date\n- Document configuration options\n- Maintain changelog\n\n## Performance\n- Optimize critical code paths\n- Use appropriate data structures\n- Minimize database queries\n- Implement caching where appropriate\n- Monitor and profile performance \n```\n","data":{"title":"Code Quality Standards","description":"Rules for maintaining high code quality across all projects.","layout":"markdown.njk","category":"Development","tags":["standards","best practices","development"],"date":"2024-03-20","discipline":"development"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"url":"/prompt_library/development/rules/code-quality/","discipline":"development","contentType":"","tags":["standards","best practices","development"],"date":"2024-03-20"},{"title":"Drupal 11 Development Standards","description":"Rules for maintaining high code quality in Drupal 11 projects.","content":{"content":"```\n# Drupal 11 Development Standards\n\n## Drupal Coding Standards\n- Follow Drupal core coding standards\n- Use PHPCS and DrupalPractice for code review\n- Implement proper dependency injection\n- Use Drupal's service container\n- Follow PSR-4 autoloading standards\n- Avoid creating classes in a \"Service\" namespace, such as Drupal\\my_module\\Service. Instead, create classes in names spaces that logically group with existing classes. If no such group is possible, create classes in the root of the module namespace instead.\n\n## Module Development\n- Use proper module structure\n- Implement proper hook system\n- Use configuration management\n- Follow Drupal's plugin system\n- Implement proper update hooks\n- Always use `\\GuzzleHttp\\Utils::jsonDecode` and `\\GuzzleHttp\\Utils::jsonEncode` instead of PHP's `json_encode` and `json_decode` methods.\n\n## Theme Development\n- Use proper theme structure\n- Follow Twig best practices\n- Implement proper asset libraries\n- Use Drupal's breakpoint system\n- Follow accessibility standards\n\n## Security\n- Use Drupal's security APIs\n- Implement proper access control\n- Use Drupal's database abstraction\n- Sanitize all user input\n- Escape all output\n\n## Performance\n- Use Drupal's caching system\n- Optimize entity queries\n- Implement proper cache tags\n- Use lazy loading where appropriate\n- Optimize asset delivery\n\n## Testing\n- Write PHPUnit tests\n- Use Drupal's testing framework\n- Test all custom functionality\n- Include functional tests\n- Test edge cases\n\n## Documentation\n- Document all custom code\n- Use proper docblocks\n- Document configuration\n- Maintain README files\n- Document deployment process\n\n## Logging\n- Do not create separate \"debug\" flags for debug logging.

This involves sending a `repository_dispatch` event with the type `slack-prompt-submission` to the GitHub API endpoint for this repository (`/repos/Lullabot/prompt_library/dispatches`). The event's `client_payload` must include the content, necessary metadata (author, invoker, permalink), and a pre-configured shared secret for validation. Successful dispatch triggers a workflow that creates a GitHub issue with the submitted content for review. See the workflow file `.github/workflows/slack_submit.yml` and the associated pull request (#40) for payload details and setup instructions.\n\n1. Fork the repository\n2.

It organizes AI prompts, rules, project configurations, and workflow states across different disciplines (Development, Project Management, Sales & Marketing, Content Strategy, Design, Quality Assurance).\n\n## Working Effectively\n\n### Bootstrap and Build the Repository\n```bash\n# Install dependencies - TIMEOUT: 60+ seconds minimum\nnpm install\n# Build time: <1 second. TIMEOUT: 30+ seconds minimum \nnpm run build\n```\n\n### Development Server\n```bash\n# Start development server - runs immediately, use async=true\nnpm start\n# Server runs at: http://localhost:8080/prompt_library/\n# NEVER CANCEL the dev server - it runs continuously for development\n```\n\n### Check for Security Issues\n```bash\n# Check npm audit - typically shows 1 low severity issue (brace-expansion)\nnpm audit\n# This is a known issue and does not affect functionality\n```\n\n## Validation Requirements\n\n### MANDATORY End-to-End Validation\nAfter making ANY changes to the codebase, ALWAYS perform this complete validation sequence:\n\n1. **Build Validation**:\n   ```bash\n   npm run build\n   # Verify build completes successfully with \"Wrote XX files\" message\n   ```\n\n2. **Development Server Testing**:\n   ```bash\n   npm start  # Use async=true\n   # Navigate to http://localhost:8080/prompt_library/\n   ```\n\n3. **Manual Site Testing** - CRITICAL:\n   - Verify homepage loads with \"Prompt Library\" title\n   - Test navigation to at least one discipline (e.g., /development/)\n   - Test clicking on a specific content item (e.g., AI Code Review)\n   - Verify search functionality works (type in search box)\n   - Confirm content displays with proper formatting\n   - Check that code blocks show copy buttons (if present)\n\n### Content Validation\nWhen adding or modifying content files:\n\n1. **Follow Content Structure**:\n   ```\n   <discipline>/<content-type>/<filename>.md\n   ```\n\n2. **Required Frontmatter**:\n   ```yaml\n   ---\n   title: \"Your Title Here\"\n   description: \"Clear description\"\n   date: \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n   layout: \"markdown.njk\"\n   discipline: \"<discipline-name>\"\n   contentType: \"<content-type>\"\n   tags:\n     - relevant\n     - tags\n   ---\n   ```\n\n3. **Prompt Content Special Format**:\n   For files in any `*/prompts/` directory, wrap content in five backticks:\n   ```\n   ---\n   frontmatter...\n   ---\n   `````\n   Your prompt content here\n   `````\n   ```\n\n4. **Test Content Locally**:\n   ```bash\n   npm start  # async=true\n   # Visit: http://localhost:8080/prompt_library/<discipline>/<content-type>/<filename>/\n   # Verify content renders correctly with proper formatting\n   ```\n\n## Build and Deployment Process\n\n### Local Development\n- **Development server**: Instant startup, hot reload enabled\n- **Build process**: Sub-second builds, generates `_site/` directory\n- **Base URL**: All URLs include `/prompt_library/` prefix for GitHub Pages\n\n### CI/CD Pipeline\n- **Automatic deployment**: Pushes to `main` branch trigger GitHub Pages deployment\n- **PR previews**: Tugboat creates preview environments for pull requests\n- **Node.js version**: Deployment uses Node.js v22 (local development works with v16+)\n\n## Key File Locations\n\n### Configuration Files\n- `.eleventy.js` - Main 11ty configuration, collections, and filters\n- `package.json` - Dependencies and npm scripts\n- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Pages deployment\n- `.tugboat/config.yml` - PR preview environment configuration\n\n### Content Structure\n```\n├── development/           # Development discipline\n├── project-management/    # Project Management discipline  \n├── sales-marketing/      # Sales & Marketing discipline\n├── content-strategy/     # Content Strategy discipline\n├── design/              # Design discipline\n├── quality-assurance/   # Quality Assurance discipline\n└── Each contains:\n    ├── prompts/         # AI prompts\n    ├── rules/          # Development guidelines\n    ├── project-configs/ # Configuration templates\n    ├── workflow-states/ # Process documentation\n    └── resources/       # Reference materials\n```\n\n### Important Templates\n- `_layouts/` - Page layout templates\n- `_includes/` - Reusable components\n- `_data/` - Global data files\n- `assets/` - CSS, JavaScript, and images\n\n## Content Submission\n\n### GitHub Issue Templates\n- Prompts: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/prompt-submission.yml`\n- Rules: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rule-submission.yml`\n- Project Configs: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/project-config-submission.yml`\n- Workflow States: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/workflow-state-submission.yml`\n\n### Programmatic Submission\n- Slack integration via repository_dispatch events\n- See `.github/workflows/slack_submit.yml` for payload structure\n\n## Common Tasks and Expected Timing\n\n### Repository Setup (Fresh Clone)\n```bash\ngit clone <repository-url>\ncd prompt_library\nnpm install        # ~8-10 seconds, TIMEOUT: 60+ seconds\nnpm run build      # <1 second, TIMEOUT: 30+ seconds  \nnpm start          # Immediate startup, use async=true\n```\n\n### Content Development Workflow\n```bash\n# 1.

Build to verify no errors\nnpm run build      # <1 second, TIMEOUT: 30+ seconds\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- **Build errors**: Check console output for 11ty error messages\n- **Content not showing**: Verify frontmatter fields match requirements\n- **Search not working**: Rebuild to regenerate search-index.json\n- **Styling issues**: Check if assets are copying correctly\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n### Essential URLs (Development)\n- Homepage: `http://localhost:8080/prompt_library/`\n- Development: `http://localhost:8080/prompt_library/development/`\n- Help: `http://localhost:8080/prompt_library/help/`\n- Contributing: `http://localhost:8080/prompt_library/contributing/`\n\n### No Formal Testing\n- **npm test**: Returns error message (no test suite configured)\n- **Validation**: Manual testing via development server is the primary validation method\n- **Quality assurance**: Content review and manual site testing\n\n### Performance Expectations\n- **Build time**: Sub-second for typical changes\n- **Dev server startup**: Immediate\n- **Hot reload**: Instant on file changes\n- **Page generation**: ~60 files generated in <1 second\n\n**CRITICAL**: Always perform complete end-to-end validation including manual site testing. Simply starting and stopping the development server is NOT sufficient - you must navigate the site, test functionality, and verify content displays correctly.","data":{},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"url":"/prompt_library/.github/copilot-instructions/","discipline":"","contentType":"","tags":[],"date":"2025-09-12T03:45:29.423Z"},{"title":"","description":"","content":{"content":"# Active Context\n\n## Current Focus\n- Implementing and testing GitHub Issue Templates as a primary method for content contribution, aligning with an \"invite and curate\" strategy.\n- Refining the contribution workflow based on discussions in Issue #34.\n- Ensuring all discipline/content-type folders (including QA) are properly initialized with customized `index.njk` files containing relevant metadata and placeholder content, replacing any `.gitkeep` files.\n- **FIXED:** Quality Assurance discipline was missing from Eleventy's config.

It eliminates the need to search across disparate locations or rely on ad-hoc sharing methods.\n\n## How It Should Work\nThe collection is presented through a web user interface built with the 11ty static site generator. Content is stored in flat Markdown files and organized by discipline (e.g., Project Management, Development). Users access the content via this web UI.\n\n## User Experience Goals\nThe user experience should be straightforward and intuitive. Users should be able to:\n*   Easily search for specific content using a search bar.\n*   Browse content categorized by discipline.\n*   Find clear instructions on how to contribute their own content to the library.\n*   **Contribution Strategy:** Employ an \"invite and curate\" model, encouraging contributions through various channels, including user-friendly GitHub Issue Templates/Forms, with maintainers handling the final integration.

If a discipline is missing from this array, its content will not appear in collections, the homepage, or navigation. This caused the Quality Assurance section to be invisible until fixed.\n\n## Templating\n- Nunjucks (.njk) is used as the primary templating engine (for md, html, data files).\n- Key layout files:\n    - `_layouts/base.njk`\n    - `_layouts/discipline.njk`\n    - `_layouts/content-type.njk`\n- Includes/partials are stored in `_includes/`.\n- Global data is stored in `_data/`.\n- Custom Nunjucks filters defined in `.eleventy.js`: `date`, `filterByDiscipline`, `fullUrl`, `hasContent`.\n- Directory structure configured in `.eleventy.js`: input (`.`), output (`_site`), includes (`_includes`), layouts (`_layouts`), data (`_data`).\n\n## Search\n- A search index (`search-index.json`) is generated during build containing title, description, content, url, discipline, contentType, tags, and date for all `.md` files.\n- Search functionality is implemented client-side via JavaScript in `_includes/search.njk`.\n- **Implementation:**\n    - Fetches `search-index.json` on page load.\n    - Filters the index in the browser based on user input (case-insensitive matching on title, description, content, tags).\n    - Results displayed dynamically, updating as user types (min 2 chars).\n- **Features:**\n    - Results link to the content page.\n    - \"View Prompt\" button on each result opens a modal displaying the full Markdown content rendered using `marked.parse()` (requires `marked.js` library).\n- Styling for search components and modal is included within `_includes/search.njk`.\n\n## Styling & Assets\n- Static assets (CSS, JS, Images) are located in the `assets/` directory and copied directly to `_site/assets` during build.\n\n## CI/CD\n- GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.\n- **Trigger:** Runs on push to `main` branch and `workflow_dispatch`.\n- **Environment:** `ubuntu-latest` with Node.js v22.\n- **Process:**\n    1. Checkout code.\n    2. Setup Node.js & cache npm dependencies.\n    3. Install dependencies (`npm install`).\n    4. Build site (`npm run build`) - output to `./_site`.\n    5. Deploy `./_site` contents to `gh-pages` branch using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4`.\n- The build process adapts URLs based on `process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS` (adds `/prompt_library` base path), configured in `.eleventy.js`.\n- A `baseUrl` global variable and `pathPrefix` are configured in `.eleventy.js` to handle deployment to GitHub Pages subpath.\n\n## Contribution Process\n- Contribution guidelines are documented in the `contributing.njk` page.\n- **Methods:**\n    - **GitHub Direct:** Standard Fork -> Branch -> Add File -> Commit -> PR workflow.\n    - **Cursor:** Recommends using Cursor AI with the `prompt-library-requirements` rule for guided content creation.\n    - **GitHub Issues:** Allows users to suggest content via issues tagged \"Content Suggestion:\".\n- **Content Requirements:**\n    - **Metadata (Frontmatter):** `title`, `description`, `date`, `tags` (min 2).\n    - **Formatting:** Markdown, clear headings, code blocks, reasonable line length, lists.\n    - **Validation:** Check metadata, preview locally (`npm start`), validate links/code, check style.\n- The `contributing.njk` page includes an accordion UI (JS/CSS) to present the methods.\n\n### Planned Contribution Workflow (via Issue Templates)\n- **Initiation:** Contributor selects an Issue Template (e.g., for prompts) and fills out the form.\n- **Submission:** A GitHub Issue is created with structured data and specific labels (e.g., `new-contribution`, `needs-review`).\n- **Curation:** Maintainer reviews the issue, verifies the content, and potentially refines the data (e.g., adds tags).\n- **Conversion:** Maintainer manually creates the corresponding Markdown file in the correct location, populating the frontmatter and content from the issue data.\n- **Integration:** Maintainer commits the new file, typically via a PR, for final review and merge.\n\n### Slack Prompt Submission Workflow (via GitHub Actions)\n- **Initiation:** A Slack bot sends a `repository_dispatch` event (`type: slack-prompt-submission`) to the GitHub API for this repository.\n- **Payload:** The event's `client_payload` contains the prompt content, author, invoker, permalink, and a shared secret.\n- **Trigger:** The dispatch event triggers the `.github/workflows/slack_submit.yml` workflow.\n- **Validation:** The workflow validates the shared secret against a repository secret (`secrets.SLACK_SHARED_SECRET`) and checks for required fields in the payload.\n- **Issue Creation:** If validation passes, the workflow uses the GitHub API (via `gh` CLI with `GITHUB_TOKEN`) to create a new issue in this repository, formatted with the content and metadata from the payload.\n- **Labels:** The issue is automatically labeled (e.g., `new-prompt`, `from-slack`).\n- **Response Limitation:** The workflow trigger (`repository_dispatch`) does not return a custom response body to the caller (Slack bot). The bot only receives confirmation that the event was dispatched (HTTP 204), not that the issue was successfully created.\n- **Maintainer Action:** This issue follows the same curation and conversion process as issues created via templates. \n\n## Section Initialization Pattern\n- All discipline/content-type folders (e.g., `quality-assurance/prompts/`, `quality-assurance/rules/`, etc.) should be initialized with a customized `index.njk` file containing relevant metadata (title, description, layout, discipline, contentType, category) and placeholder content describing the section's purpose.\n- This replaces the use of `.gitkeep` files for empty folder tracking, ensuring each section is ready for content and discoverable in the UI.\n- This pattern was applied to the Quality Assurance section, with each subfolder now containing a Quality Assurance-specific `index.njk` file. \n","data":{},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},"url":"/prompt_library/memory-bank/systemPatterns/","discipline":"","contentType":"","tags":[],"date":"2025-09-12T03:45:29.423Z"},{"title":"","description":"","content":{"content":"# Tech Context\n\n## Core Technologies\n- **Static Site Generator:** 11ty (Eleventy)\n- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages\n- **Content Format:** Markdown (.md)\n- **Runtime:** Node.js (v16 or higher required)\n- **Package Manager:** npm (or yarn)\n- **Version Control:** Git\n\n## Supporting Technologies / Formats\n- **GitHub Issue Templates:** YAML format used for creating structured issue forms (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml`).\n- **GitHub Actions (`repository_dispatch`):** Used to receive external events (like Slack prompt submissions) and trigger workflows.
