# Code Quality Standards

## General Principles
1. Write code that is easy to read and understand
2. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
3. Keep functions and methods small and focused
4. Use meaningful variable and function names
5. Document complex logic and decisions

## Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Follow language-specific style guides
- Use proper spacing around operators
- Limit line length to 80-100 characters
- Use descriptive comments where necessary

## Testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests independent and isolated

## Documentation
- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Include usage examples
- Keep README files up to date
- Document configuration options
- Maintain changelog

## Performance
- Optimize critical code paths
- Use appropriate data structures
- Minimize database queries
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Monitor and profile performance
