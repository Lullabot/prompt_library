# Project Guidelines

These rules apply to all files in the project and define our standards for code quality, testing, performance, and accessibility.

## Code Quality and Maintenance
- Keep changes small and focused on a single feature or fix
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Document any complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Testing and Validation
- Test all changes locally before committing
- Ensure all new features have corresponding tests
- Run the full test suite before pushing changes
- Validate that the site builds successfully with 11ty
- Check that all links and assets work correctly

## Performance and Optimization
- Keep the application lightweight and fast
- Optimize images and assets before committing
- Minimize JavaScript usage where possible
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms
- Cache results when appropriate

## Content Management
- Store prompts in a structured, searchable format
- Use consistent metadata for all content
- Keep example files organized and well-documented
- Maintain clear separation between content and presentation
- Use appropriate content types for different prompt categories

## GitHub Pages Specific
- Ensure all paths are relative for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Test the site locally in production mode before deploying
- Keep the build process simple and reliable
- Document any GitHub Pages specific configurations
- Maintain proper CORS and security headers

## Development Workflow
- Create feature branches for new development
- Review code changes before merging
- Keep the main branch stable and deployable
- Use pull requests for code review
- Document any environment-specific requirements

## File Organization
- Keep the project structure clean and logical
- Use appropriate file extensions
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Group related files together
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

## Accessibility and Standards
- Ensure all content is accessible
- Follow web standards and best practices
- Use semantic HTML where possible
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
