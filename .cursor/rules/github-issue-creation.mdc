# GitHub Issue Creation Guidelines

When creating GitHub issues through the GitHub API, always use the current repository context:

- Owner: Lullabot
- Repository: prompt_library

This ensures that issues are created in the correct repository without requiring explicit specification each time.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// The repository context is automatically set
await createIssue({
  title: "Issue Title",
  body: "Issue description"
});
```

## Benefits

- Maintains consistency across issue creation
- Reduces potential for errors in repository targeting
- Streamlines the issue creation process

## Implementation Notes

The repository context should be automatically inferred from the workspace environment rather than hardcoded in individual commands.
