# GitHub Wiki

## Overview

GitHub wikis are powered by [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum),
a git-backed wiki engine. Wiki content lives in a separate `.wiki.git`
repository alongside the main code repository. Understanding Gollum's
link syntax and page resolution is essential — it differs from both
standard Markdown and MediaWiki in ways that cause subtle, hard-to-debug
broken links.

## Critical: Link Syntax

**The most common mistake when working with GitHub wikis is getting the
pipe syntax backwards.** Gollum uses the opposite order from MediaWiki:

```
CORRECT:  [[Display Text|page-name]]
WRONG:    [[page-name|Display Text]]
```

- Left of pipe = what the reader sees
- Right of pipe = the page to link to (filename without `.md`)

When the order is reversed, links silently resolve to non-existent pages
and render as red/broken links with no error message.

## Working with Wiki Repositories

### Locating the Wiki Repo

Wiki repositories are cloned separately from the main repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.wiki.git
```

### Pushing Changes

Wiki changes are pushed with standard git commands. Changes appear
on GitHub immediately after push — there is no build step or CI.

```bash
cd path/to/repo.wiki
git add -A
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin master
```

Note: Wiki repos typically use `master` as the default branch, not `main`.

## Creating Wiki Pages

### Page Files

Each wiki page is a Markdown file at the root of the wiki repository.

- **Filename** = URL slug and link target (e.g., `my-page.md` → `/wiki/my-page`)
- **H1 heading** = Page title displayed at the top
- Use **kebab-case** for filenames: `setup-guide.md`, not `Setup Guide.md`
- Capitalize proper nouns: `Banner.md`, `Home.md`

### Naming for Grouping

Prefix related pages to keep them organized:

```
its-training-session-1-pantheon.md
its-training-session-2-git.md
its-training-session-3-drupal.md
```

### Internal Links

Always use wiki-style `[[links]]` for internal pages:

```markdown
See [[Setup Guide|setup-guide]] for details.
```

Never use markdown-style `[text](page)` for internal wiki links — they
will not resolve.

### Cross-Page Navigation

Add prev/next navigation at the bottom of sequential pages:

```markdown
**Previous:** [[Session 1|training-session-1]] | **Next:** [[Session 3|training-session-3]]
```

## Special Pages

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Home.md` | Landing page, always exists |
| `_Sidebar.md` | Navigation sidebar, rendered on every page |
| `_Footer.md` | Footer rendered on every page (optional) |
| `_Header.md` | Header rendered on every page (optional, rare) |

### Sidebar Best Practices

Keep the sidebar organized with sections and wiki-style links:

```markdown
# Project Wiki

[[Home]]

---

### Section Name

- [[Page One|page-one]]
- [[Page Two|page-two]]

---

### External Links

- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues)
```

## Images

Store images in an `images/` directory at the wiki repo root.
Reference with standard markdown or wiki syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](images/screenshot.png)
```

GitHub wiki does not support image sizing in markdown. Use HTML for
controlled dimensions:

```html
<img src="images/screenshot.png" alt="Alt text" width="600">
```

## Workflow: Adding a New Wiki Section

1. **Create the page files** at the wiki repo root with kebab-case names
2. **Add internal links** using `[[Display Text|page-name]]` syntax
3. **Update `_Sidebar.md`** to add navigation links to the new pages
4. **Update `Home.md`** if the new section should be listed on the landing page
5. **Commit and push** to make changes live immediately
6. **Verify links** — broken links render as red text with class `internal absent`

## Troubleshooting

### Links Show as Red / "absent"

- Check pipe order: must be `[[Display|target]]` not `[[target|Display]]`
- Verify the target filename exists (without `.md` extension) at repo root
- Check for typos — resolution is case-insensitive but must otherwise match

### Images Not Rendering

- Verify the image file is committed and pushed to the wiki repo
- Check the relative path from the wiki root (e.g., `images/file.png`)
- Ensure the image filename has no spaces

### Page Not Appearing in Wiki

- Verify the `.md` file is at the repository root (not in a subdirectory
  unless using Gollum subdirectory support)
- Verify the file was pushed to the remote (`git push origin master`)
- Check that the file has a `.md` extension
