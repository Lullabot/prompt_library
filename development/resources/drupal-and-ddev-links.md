# How and Why to Add Docs to Cursor

Adding documentation to Cursor (or similar AI agents) is essential for providing persistent, reusable context that improves the agent's accuracy and usefulness. Well-maintained docs reduce hallucinations, standardize workflows, and encode domain knowledge for both humans and AI.

## How to Add Docs to Cursor

- Open the `@Docs` panel in Cursor and select **Add new doc**.
- Paste the URL of the documentation you want to add. (Tip: Add a trailing slash to the URL to index all subpages and subdirectories.)
- Cursor will crawl, index, and keep your custom doc up to date automatically.
- You can manage your custom docs in **Settings > Features > Docs**â€”edit, delete, or add new docs as needed.
- Once added, reference your custom docs in chat or prompts using the `@Docs` symbol to bring them into context for the agent.
