# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
To provide a central, organized repository for AI prompts, rules, project configurations, and workflow states.

## Problems It Solves
Addresses the issue of scattered resources, making it difficult for individuals to find and share relevant prompts, rules, configurations, and workflows efficiently. It eliminates the need to search across disparate locations or rely on ad-hoc sharing methods.

## How It Should Work
The collection is presented through a web user interface built with the 11ty static site generator. Content is stored in flat Markdown files and organized by discipline (e.g., Project Management, Development). Users access the content via this web UI.

## User Experience Goals
The user experience should be straightforward and intuitive. Users should be able to:
*   Easily search for specific content using a search bar.
*   Browse content categorized by discipline.
*   Find clear instructions on how to contribute their own content to the library.
*   **Contribution Strategy:** Employ an "invite and curate" model, encouraging contributions through various channels, including user-friendly GitHub Issue Templates/Forms, with maintainers handling the final integration.
