# Progress

## What Works / Exists
- Project repository cloned.
- Basic project structure as defined in `README.md` is present.
- Core memory bank files created and populated with initial project details and context.
- Dependencies verified via `package.json` (`@11ty/eleventy@^3.0.0`).
- 11ty configuration (`.eleventy.js`) details (collections, filters, search index generation, directory structure, base path handling) documented.
- CI/CD workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) identified and basic purpose (deployment, base path handling) documented.
- Initial content is populated in discipline directories (e.g., `development/`, `project-management/`).
- Search UI implemented (see `_includes/search.njk`).
- Search UI implementation details (client-side, uses `search-index.json`, includes modal view) understood and documented.
- Contribution process documented (see `contributing.njk`).
- Contribution process details (GitHub, Cursor w/ rules, Issues methods; metadata/formatting requirements) understood and documented.
- Content file structure verified (discipline folders, content-type subfolders, `kebab-case.md` file naming, presence of `index.njk` at both levels).
- **GitHub Issue Template:** Created initial template (`prompt-submission.yml`) for submitting prompts via issues.
- **Quality Assurance Section Initialization:** All `quality-assurance/` subfolders now have customized `index.njk` files with Quality Assurance-specific metadata and placeholder content, replacing `.gitkeep` files.
- **Quality Assurance Config Fix:** The Eleventy config now includes 'quality-assurance' in the disciplines array, so QA content is visible and highlighted on the homepage and navigation.

## What's Left to Build / Document
- Verification of the *actual* file structure and content existence within all discipline/content-type folders.
- Detailed documentation for specific components or features if needed (e.g., specific 11ty filters).
- Further population of content across all disciplines and types.
- **Define Maintainer Workflow:** Process for handling issue template submissions needs to be defined and documented.
- **Update Contribution Docs:** `contributing.njk` needs to be updated to feature the issue template method.
- **Additional Issue Templates:** Templates for other content types (workflows, rules, etc.) may be needed.

## Known Issues
- None identified yet.
