# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing and testing GitHub Issue Templates as a primary method for content contribution, aligning with an "invite and curate" strategy.
- Refining the contribution workflow based on discussions in Issue #34.

## Recent Activity
- Discussed various approaches to simplifying contribution and frontmatter generation (GitHub Issue #34).
- Explored GitHub Issue Templates/Forms as a user-friendly option.
- Drafted and created the initial `prompt-submission.yml` template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

## Next Steps

- **Define Maintainer Workflow:** Document the process for maintainers to review issue submissions and convert them into markdown files with correct frontmatter and structure.
- **Finalize Template Fields:** Review and finalize the dropdown options for `discipline` and `content-type` in `prompt-submission.yml`.
- **Create More Templates:** Draft and create similar issue templates for other content types (workflows, rules, configs) as needed.
- **Update Contribution Docs:** Update `contributing.njk` to reflect the primary use of issue templates.
